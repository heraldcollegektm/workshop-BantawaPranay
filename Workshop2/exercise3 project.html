        The word "Hacking" caught  my attention. When I was a beginner in the field of Cyber Security. I Thought that hacking someone's wifi password, social media account with a phishing method are all advanced levels of hacking. During the Covid 19 Pandemic all of us are at home. We have free time to explore new things. One day I was scrolling on FaceBook peacefully and suddenly I saw a guy named Sujan Thapa Magar brother posted about his bounty $xxx. Then something hit my mind, Well what's that. He is getting paid for doing what! Then I asked him and he told me that he found bugs in some programs and they paid him $xxxx for that. From him I know the word "Bug Bounty". He gave me an idea about bug bounty, not all the advanced level ideas like how to find the bugs. I started to research bug bounty from  Google, Youtube  and learn the basic vulnerability  In website. Now I have some basic knowledge about vulnerability.
